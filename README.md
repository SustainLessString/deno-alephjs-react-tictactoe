# deno-alephjs-react-tictactoe

## What is this

[This](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) is tic-tac-toe with react and [Aleph.js](https://alephjs.org/docs/get-started) framework in [deno](https://deno.land) environment.

## It's yoinked-ed, isn't it?

Based on this [guide](https://betterprogramming.pub/321f78d8d1e0).
Some changes were made for Aleph.js in deno.

## How?

### Installation?
1. Go to Deno's installation [manual](https://deno.land/#installation).
2. Go to Aleph.js's installation [manual](https://alephjs.org/docs/get-started).
3. Go to React's own long but wholesome tic-tac-toe [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).
    * or simply this simple-yet-works [guide](https://betterprogramming.pub/321f78d8d1e0).
4. Why is it not working?

## Any last word?

Give deno a try, you will love it.
Aleph.js is young, but her future is bright. Probably. Eventually.
